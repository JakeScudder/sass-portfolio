          <p>
            As a co-founder of <a class="juice-link" href="https://www.thejuicelaundry.com/" ><span class="text-secondary"> The Juice Laundry</span></a>, we effectively increased our
            revenue by 200% over 6 years.  Despite our success, I couldn't help feeling that I needed a different challenge. As of February of
            2020 I received my Full Stack Javascript Techdegree from Treehouse,
            exceeding expectations on each project. Javascript, HTML, CSS,
            Node.js, and React are just a few of the techonologies I am
            confident in, but each day I continue to add more bricks to my
            coding repertoire. This site employs Sass, a precursor to CSS, which
            is something I didn't know a few days ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learn quickly and am passionate about landing my first job in
            software development. I would love to talk to you about how I could
            be valuable to your team.
